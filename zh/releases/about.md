Wiki.js is built almost exclusively by 1 developer, without compensation, on his free time (weeknights and weekends). **Please be mindful of this fact** when writing comments like:

- *I need feature X urgently! When can I expect feature X? My company needs it now!*
- *Why don't you have a fully detailed timeline, with precise dates for new releases?*
- *Feature X is most important to us. Please work on it as a priority.*
- *I posted a ticket on GitHub a few hours ago and you haven't replied yet!*
- *This feature was marked as Planned 2 months ago and it's still not released!*

With the exception of issues that are deamed **critical** *(security hole, major crash, etc.)* that are usually fixed within days, it's simply not possible to have a clear release schedule planned for months in advance and with fixed release dates.

You can track the progress of the next release on the [Release Notes](/releases) page along with planned features.

## How can I help?

### Pull Requests

Pull requests to fix bugs or submit a new feature are always welcome! Look at [current issues](https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/issues) on what can be worked on. Most issues are tagged with the level of difficulty expected to resolve the issue.

### Donations

You can contribute financially in order to support this project. Contributions help cover the costs of servers and networking services, along with some developer tools.

If a large amount of recurring donations is achieved, it would then be possible for the lead developer to work full-time on the project.
