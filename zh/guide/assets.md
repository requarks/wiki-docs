# Basics

All editors have a button to open the Assets dialog. Refer to the documentation of each [editor](/editors) for more information.

The assets can be of any file type; images, documents, zip, etc.

Images will automatically be displayed as images while other file types will simply display a standard link.

## Upload an Asset

Use the **Upload Assets** section to upload new assets. You can either click on **Browse...** button, on the grey area just below or by drag-n-drop files onto the grey area directly.

Once ready, click the **Upload** button to initiate the upload for all files.

## Use an Asset

Select the asset you want to insert, then click the **Insert** button.

### Image Alignment

When inserting an image, you can also set a specic alignment using the **Image Alignment** dropdown menu (to the right of dialog).

- **Left**: Align to the left of the page.
- **Centered**: Align to the center of the page.
- **Right**: Align to the right of the page.
- **Absolute Top Right**: Display as a logo in the top-right corner of the page.
