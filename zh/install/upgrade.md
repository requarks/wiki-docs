> **DO NOT** upgrade from `1.0.x` using these instructions! Use the [Migrate from Wiki.js v1.x](/install/migrate) instructions instead. These instructions are for `2.x` installations.
{.is-danger}

> While upgrades are generally safe and it's very unlikely that it would result in data loss, **it's your responsibility to have a proper backup of your database before performing an upgrade.** Note that it's not possible to go back to a previous version of Wiki.js once the database schema has been upgraded.

# In-place Upgrade

Select your platform:

## Platforms {.tabset}

### Docker <i class="mdi mdi-docker"></i>

#### Standalone Container

Upgrading is simply a matter of recreating the container with the latest image version:

```bash
# Stop and remove container named "wiki"
docker stop wiki
docker rm wiki

# Pull latest image of Wiki.js
docker pull ghcr.io/requarks/wiki:2

# Create new container of Wiki.js based on latest image
docker run -d -p 8080:3000 --name wiki --restart unless-stopped -e "DB_TYPE=mysql" -e "DB_HOST=db" -e "DB_PORT=3306" -e "DB_USER=wikijs" -e "DB_PASS=wikijsrocks" -e "DB_NAME=wiki" ghcr.io/requarks/wiki:2
```

Check out the [Docker installation guide](/install/docker) for all the possible options when creating a Wiki.js container.

#### Docker Compose

The following commands will pull the latest image and recreate the containers defined in the docker-compose file:

```bash
docker-compose pull wiki
docker-compose up --force-recreate
```

### Linux / macOS <i class="mdi mdi-ubuntu"></i>

> The commands below assume an installation within a subfolder named `wiki`.
{.is-info}

1) Stop the running Wiki.js instance
2) Make a backup of your `config.yml` file.
  ```bash
  cp wiki/config.yml ~/config.yml.bak
  ```
3) Delete the application folder.
  ```bash
  rm -rf wiki/*
  ```
4) Download the latest version of Wiki.js.
  ```bash
  wget https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/releases/latest/download/wiki-js.tar.gz
  ```
5) Extract the package
  ```bash
  tar xzf wiki-js.tar.gz -C ./wiki
  cd wiki
  ```
6) Restore your config.yml back to its original location.
  ```bash
  cp ~/config.yml.bak ./config.yml
  ```
7) Start Wiki.js
  ```bash
  node server
  ```

### Windows <i class="mdi mdi-microsoft-windows"></i>

> The commands below assume an installation at folder location `C:\wiki`.
{.is-info}

1. Open a **Powershell** prompt in administrator mode.
1. Make a backup of `config.yml` file.
  ```powershell
  Copy-Item "C:\wiki\config.yml" -Destination "C:\config.yml.bak"
  ```
3. Delete the application folder contents.
  ```powershell
  Clear-Content "C:\wiki\*"
  ```
4. If you are using **Windows 7 / Windows Server 2008 R2 or older**, you must run the following command. *(otherwise skip this step)*
  ```powershell
  [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
  ```
5. Download the latest version of Wiki.js:
  ```powershell
  Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/releases/latest/download/wiki-js-windows.tar.gz" -OutFile "wiki-js.tar.gz"
  ```

4. Extract the package to the final destination of your choice:
  ```powershell
  tar xzf wiki-js.tar.gz -C "C:\wiki"
  cd C:\wiki
  ```
  > The **tar** utility is only available on Windows 10. On earlier versions, you'll need a 3rd-party utility like [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the file.
  {.is-warning}
5. Copy your `config.yml` backup file back to it's original location.
  ```powershell
  Copy-Item "C:\config.yml.bak" -Destination "C:\wiki\config.yml"
  ```
6. Run Wiki.js
  ```powershell
  node server
  ```
  
# Migrate between servers

Read the [transfer between servers](/install/transfer) guide to learn how to move an existing 2.x Wiki.js installation to a new server.

> Note that the new server Wiki.js version doesn't need to match the old server. The installation will automatically be updated to the latest version upon restore. For example, it's perfectly safe to migrate a 2.2 installation on the old server to 2.5 on the new server.
