New installations ship with the **English** locale by default.

# Download Locales

You can download new locale packages, made by contributors, via the **Administration Area**.

In the left sidebar, click on **Locales**. A list of available locales will be displayed on the right.

Click the :cloud: **cloud icon** next to the locale you wish to download. When completed, the locale will be available in the **Site Locale** dropdown list.
