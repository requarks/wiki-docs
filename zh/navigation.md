# Edit Navigation

The navigation mode and its configuration can be modified from the **Administration Area**, under the **Navigation** section.

# Navigation Modes

There're 4 navigation modes.

## Site Tree

The sidebar lists all pages and folders on your wiki, in a structured tree manner. Only pages the user has access to will be displayed. This is similar to the directory tree found in most operating systems.

## Static Navigation

The sidebar displays a static list of links, defined by the administrator(s). This is useful when you want to control precisely what the user sees. Links are added manually in the **Administration Area**, under the **Navigation** section.

3 types of navigation items can be added:
- **Header**: Simple text used to categorize a group of links.
- **Link**: A clickable link pointing to an internal page or an external URL, with an icon on the left.
- **Divider**: A separator line, to clearly separate 2 group of links.

Each navigation item can be either visible to everyone or to specific groups only.

Navigation items can be freely re-ordered using drag-n-drop.

## Custom Navigation

Custom Navigation combines the **Site Tree** and **Static Navigation** modes together. Both modes are available in the sidebar and the user can switch between them by clicking either the **Main Menu** or **Browse** button at the top of the sidebar. A link to the homepage is also displayed to the left of this button.

> This is the default navigation mode.

## None

This hides the sidebar navigation altogether. Users are expected to browse your wiki solely from the pages content or via the search bar.
