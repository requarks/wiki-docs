# Folder Structure

Wiki.js doesn't have a folder structure in the traditional sense. You never need to create folders in order to create new pages. Instead, you create pages directly at the path of your choice.

For example, in order to create a page at `/universe/planets/earth`, you don't need to create the folders `universe` and `planets` in the first place. They'll be inferred automatically.

This system allows for greater flexibility and less dependencies between pages. However that doesn't mean you can't use a traditional folder system should you want to. The folder structure is still available when creating and moving pages. The only difference being you don't have to manage folders, they are inferred automatically from pages paths.

## Breadcrumbs

The breadcrumbs bar shown on top of every page is generated automatically from the path.

# Tags

Tags are a great way to categorize your pages and easily find related content. They are a much leaner alternative to using a complex system of folders to categorize your content. Tags are simple labels attached to a page.

## Set Tags

Multiple tags can be added to a page.

For example, for a page about the city **Montreal**, you could add tags `cities`, `canada`, `north-america`. These tags can then be used to quickly find the page afterwards. By browsing by tags `canada` and `cities`, the page **Montreal** will come up in the results because both of these tags are present on the page.

## Browse Tags

Use the **Browse by Tags** link (located next to the search bar, or in the navigation menu) to see a list of all tags available in the wiki.

Select one or multiple tags to view a list of pages matching the selection.
